# STM32-Interrupts
Detecting user input via button, using interrupt registers on the STM32 board (ARM Cortex M4 MCU)  

This is a school assignment for Fontys Semester 3. I am using interrupts to detect user input and display the output on 2 LEDs - an external LED wired to the breadboard 
and the internal LED of the STM32 board. You can find a detailed description of the problem, as well as my take in the form of a report in this folder. Additionally, you 
can check out my video demonstration on the link below.
